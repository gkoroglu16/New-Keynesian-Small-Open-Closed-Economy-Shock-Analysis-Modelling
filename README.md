# New-Keynesian-Small-Open-Closed-Economy-Shock-Analysis-Modelling
(The modelling is an outcome of a group work)

Quantitative Finishing Group Project ECON6008 (International Money and Finance) - Model Introduction

It is a modified version of the New-Keynesian small
open-economy (SOE) model in Justiniano and Preston (2010, henceforth JP), which in
turn is based on the model in Monacelli (2005) and Gali and Monacelli (2005). Compared
to the JP model, our modified model assumes that the law of one price (LoP) holds for
all imported retail goods and there is no price indexation for these imported goods. The
foreign economy is also modeled di§erently than in the paper (see below for further details),
although we still assume that the foreign economy is essentially a closed economy. The
model is also extended to include a labor-supply shock, which could be used as a proxy
for the supply-side disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a cost-push shock
that enters the domestic-price Phillips curve.

Aggregate fluctuations in the model are driven by 8 exogenous shocks. Five of these
shocks are domestic shocks: preference (consumer spending), risk premium, monetary policy (interest rate), cost-push, and labor supply shocks. Three of the shocks are foreign or
external shocks: foreign output, foreign ináation, and foreign interest rate shocks. These
shocks affect the domestic economy through their influence on the foreign economy's output, inflation, and nominal interest rate. The model can be derived from the ground up
with micro-foundations, based on optimizing households, domestic firms and importers,
etc., resulting in a set of non-linear equations. Instead, this works directly with the
log-linearized equilibrium equations.
